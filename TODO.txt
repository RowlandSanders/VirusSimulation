SIMULATION

NOTES: We are doing this in python, but will experiment with java if we can not accomplish the same goals

GOALS: 
1) Create a simple simulation where a user can input data on a virus and the program will simulate it on countries

TODO:
1) Collect information a variety of first world countries and give them a score out of 1000, this will be determined by many variables that are widely available 
2) Allow user to create a country to be tested
3) Create default viruses and allow user to create a virus based on 5 categories to test out against a country on the list
4) Test and tweak to make it as close to know data as possible
5) Provide or display a countries ability to beat the virus based on casualties and days.
